# 🌿 fwdslsh Manifesto

*Slash a path to simplicity.*

---

## 🔥 The Problem

We’ve lost the plot.

Developer tools have become bloated, opaque, and over-engineered.
Frameworks promise productivity, but deliver churn.
Build systems require build systems.
Every update breaks something.
Every tool becomes its own ecosystem.
And for what?

**We are burning brain cells to serve complexity.**

---

## ✊ The Resistance

**fwdslsh** is our peaceful rebellion.
A slash through the noise.
A return to clarity, control, and purpose.
A soft weapon in the hands of creators who want to build, not babysit their stack.

We believe:

* That every tool should be **understandable in a single sitting**
* That simplicity is not compromise — it’s a **superpower**
* That performance begins with **mental performance**
* That small, sharp tools are better than big, brittle ones
* That the future is not dystopian, but **solar, serene, and self-sustaining**

---

## 🌱 The Vision

We are building a suite of tools that:

* Slash through unnecessary layers
* Embrace **web standards**, **POSIX principles**, and **clean design**
* Work with your system — not against it
* Are designed to be **understood**, not just used
* Feel like old-school Unix, but with a soul from the future

This isn’t retro. This is retro-future.
**This is solarpunk for your shell.**

---

## 🧪 The Tools

Our tools are:

* 🔧 **Composable** – Use what you need, skip what you don’t
* 📦 **Frameworkless** – No more towering abstractions
* 🐚 **CLI-native** – Optimized for terminal workflows
* 🌐 **Portable** – Built for web, shell, and local-first dev

---

## 🌍 The Movement

This is not just tooling.
It’s a philosophy of digital resilience.

* **We burn complexity, not brain cells.**
* **We cut paths where others build walls.**
* **We believe tools should work for us, not the other way around.**

We are the vine growing through the concrete.
We are the slash that refuses to be silenced.
We are **fwdslsh**.
